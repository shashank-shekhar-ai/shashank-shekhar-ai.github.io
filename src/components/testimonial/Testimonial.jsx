              Shashank has delivered some amazing results at VMware. We first started working together on a highly complicated analytical model. Even though he was assigned to the project in its final weeks he was able to ramp up quickly and add tremendous value. From there we kicked off some propensity model efforts that revealed previously unknown characteristics about the behaviors of our market. On top of all this, Shashank is taking on more project management responsibilities. Itâ€™s been a great please to work with him and looking forward to continued exceptional results.
