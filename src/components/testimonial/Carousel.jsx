                      Shashank has delivered some amazing results at VMware. We
                      first started working together on a highly complicated
                      analytical model. Even though he was assigned to the
                      project in its final weeks he was able to ramp up quickly
                      and add tremendous value. From there we kicked off some
                      propensity model efforts that revealed previously unknown
                      characteristics about the behaviors of our market. On top
                      of all this, Shashank is taking on more project management
                      responsibilities. Itâ€™s been a great please to work with
